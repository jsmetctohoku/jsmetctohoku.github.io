We're thrilled to announce the successful migration of our website to a new version! After the old site, which was based on Google Sites, went offline, we took proactive steps to ensure continuity. As a result, we've seamlessly migrated all activities of the JSME TC to this new platform. This transition not only ensures the uninterrupted flow of information but also opens up exciting opportunities for enhanced functionality and improved user experience. We're excited about this new chapter and look forward to engaging our community in a more dynamic and efficient manner through our updated website
